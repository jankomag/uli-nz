This repository contains the data and code used to create and analyze the Auckland Urban Liveability Index (AULI), a spatial composite indicator that quantifies modern liveability at the neighbourhood level in Auckland, New Zealand.

An interactive web map of the AULI and its components, created with Mapbox GL JS, can be accessed [here](https://jan.magnuszewski.com/auli).

## Abstract

We present the Auckland Urban Liveability Index (AULI), an indicator that quantifies modern liveability at neighbourhood-level in Auckland. The index comprises 29 variables spanning several components of liveability: social infrastructure, green space, transportation, safety and diversity. Each is documented transparently with accompanying data and code. We find that neighbourhoods with the highest liveability scores have comparatively good public transport provision and are amenable to active travel, and that residents from Pacific and MƒÅori backgrounds disproportionately reside in neighbourhoods containing lower liveability scores. Through local modelling frameworks, we provide useful context on the generalisability of index components that supports transfer of our index to other cities in New Zealand and re-evaluation of our index in light of new data.
